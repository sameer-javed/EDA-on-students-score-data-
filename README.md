# Students' Scores EDA

## Project Overview
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information about students' scores, activities, and parental involvement, sourced from Kaggle. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights regarding how students' grades are affected by their activities and parental involvement.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains the following features:
- **Student ID**: Unique identifier for each student
- **Gender**: Gender of the student
- **Age**: Age of the student
- **Study Time**: Time spent on studying per week
- **Activity Level**: Participation in extracurricular activities
- **Parental Support**: Level of parental involvement in academic activities
- **Absences**: Number of school absences
- **Test Scores**: Scores obtained by the student in their final exam

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of:
- **Study time** on students' scores.
- **Extracurricular activities** on academic performance.
- **Parental involvement** on students' grades.
- **Other factors** like school absences on academic results.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
Some exciting insights uncovered from the analysis include:
1. **Study Time**: A positive correlation was observed between the amount of time spent studying and the students' scores.
2. **Extracurricular Activities**: Students who engaged in extracurricular activities tended to perform better academically, although there were diminishing returns beyond a certain point.
3. **Parental Involvement**: Students with active parental support in academic-related activities showed improved performance in their final exams.
4. **Absences**: High absenteeism showed a negative impact on student scores, indicating the importance of consistent attendance.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations, such as:
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Shows the relationships between different variables.
- **Bar Charts**: Comparison of students' grades based on different levels of parental involvement.
- **Histograms**: Distribution of student scores and other related features.
- **Scatter Plots**: Depicts relationships between study time, activity participation, and grades.

## Conclusion
This EDA provides valuable insights into how various factors, including study habits, extracurricular involvement, and parental support, influence students' academic performance. The findings can be useful for educators and parents aiming to improve student outcomes by focusing on these key areas.
